This application starts out with buttons depicting movie names, movie stars, or movie characters. Once a button is clicked the application returns 10 still images relating to the title of the button.  When a still image is clicked the animation begins.  When it is clicked again it is stopped.  More buttons can be generated by entering text in the input box and pressing enter or clicking submit.  The button is added to the button group and can be clicked at any time.  When a new button is pressed the previous images are replaced by the new entry.
